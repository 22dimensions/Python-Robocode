===============
 


### A Fork of Robocode for python programming

####This version won't be maintain because of a PyQt integration instead of pygame (much more faster), Watch the [PyQt branch](https://github.com/turkishviking/Python-Robocode/tree/PyQt-Robocode) for the new version

####Any help would be welcome!


##### If you aren't devleoper, watch the [Master Branch](https://github.com/turkishviking/Python-Robocode/) for the stable version



* ######What's New & Task list:

    - [x]  getTargetPosition()
    - [x]  getTargetName()
    - [x]  bulletPower
    - [x]  on_hit_by_bullet()
    - [x]  bulletSize  ---> bullet are proportional to the map size
    - [ ]  WallCollision
    - [x]  MapSize --->  The map is proportional to the number of bots
    - [x]  Number_Of_Enmies_Left()
    - [ ]  GameSpeed  ---> Physics OK, have to implement a graphic slide bar
    - [x]  on_Robot_Exit()
    - [ ]  Battle Series
    - [ ]  Batlles Statistics
    - [ ]  .exe
    - [ ]  .deb
    - [ ]  Qt IDE (syntax highlighter, auto completion, Base Robot)
    - [ ]  masked mode without screen (top speed without bliting) (need battle Series and statistic first)
    - [x]  Physics is proportional to the map size
    - [ ]  Add Classe Reference in the wiki
    - [ ]  To prevent bot's to use Sockets, urllib2, and Sub/Multi Processing Module (more safe for users)
    - [ ]  Window resizable (need to split the code in more file to clarify it).
